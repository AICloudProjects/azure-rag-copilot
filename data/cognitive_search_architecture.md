\# Azure Cognitive Search Architecture

Azure Cognitive Search consists of several core components:

\- \*\*Index\*\*: Schema defining fields, metadata, and vector representations.  
\- \*\*Indexer\*\*: Connects data sources and automates extraction.  
\- \*\*Query Engine\*\*: Executes keyword, semantic, and vector queries.  
\- \*\*Skills\*\*: Used for AI enrichment such as OCR, key phrase extraction, and translation.

Modern enterprise applications combine keyword search with semantic vector retrieval for improved relevance.
